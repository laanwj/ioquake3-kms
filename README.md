kmsquake3
==========

A version of ioquake3 that runs on bare Linux KMS, with raw evdev for
input: no X11, no Wayland. OpenGL ES 1.0 is used for rendering, through EGL.

Configuring
-------------

Currently event sources have to be configured explicitly for input to work.

Find device ids for keyboard and mouse:
```
$ dmesg|grep input

```
Set these in `~/.q3a/baseq3/q3config.cfg`:
```
seta usbm "10"
seta usbk "4"
seta x11 "0"
```
E.g. `10` for `input10`, `4` for `input4` etc.
